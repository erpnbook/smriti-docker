# Walkthrough - SMRITI PSV Enablement Program Compilation

We have successfully compiled, synchronized, and staged the comprehensive **SMRITI PSV Enablement Program**, consisting of 13 primary business enablement assets (plus additional supporting files, totaling 15 files). All assets are fully aligned with the slide journey of the SMRITI PSV Experience Center, the central Formula Registry, the Business Dictionary, and the SMRITI PSV User Manual (Volume 6). 

The assets are written in business-first language, omitting database-specific details, and they incorporate the Founder & Chief Architect profile (Jawahar R. Mallah, AITDL) at both the start and end of all major documents in compliance with **Rule 12**.

## ⚖️ Governance & Compliance Verification

*   **Rule 12 (Author Attribution)**: Validated that the structured Founder & Chief Architect profile (Jawahar R. Mallah, AITDL) is present at the start and end of all major documents (`psv_certified_planner_guide.md`, `psv_demo_script.md`, `psv_executive_faq.md`, `psv_competitive_positioning.md`).
*   **Rule 10 (Human approval)**: All files explicitly state that SMRITI remains a decision-support tool where actions require human review and approval.
*   **No Shadow Ledger Jargon**: Checked that all executive enablement assets use terms like "Inventory Visibility Layer" or "Inventory Visibility Network" instead of technical database jargon.
*   **Git Staged & Committed**: Ran verification checks and verified that both checkout repos are clean and fully committed.
