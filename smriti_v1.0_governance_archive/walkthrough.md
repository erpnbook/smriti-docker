# Walkthrough — SMRITI Retail OS v1.0 GA Release Freeze & Validation

We have successfully executed the Release Freeze and completed all post-restart runtime and database verification steps for SMRITI Retail OS v1.0 GA.

---

## 🛠️ Implemented Validation & Snapshots

### 1. Infrastructure & Service Verification
- **Container Health**: Confirmed that all 9 docker containers (`frontend`, `backend`, `queue-short`, `queue-long`, `scheduler`, `websocket`, `redis-queue`, `redis-cache`, and `db`) are `Up` and running cleanly, with `backend` and `db` reporting `healthy`.
- **Queue Check**: Verified that the three main background queues (`default`, `short`, and `long`) have exactly `0` pending or stuck jobs.
- **Scheduler check**: Enabled the scheduler and ran `bench doctor` to verify scheduler status is active and healthy.

### 2. Post-Restart Smoke Tests (Browser Automation)
All critical runtime paths were tested and passed successfully:
- **Login**: Authenticated successfully as `Administrator`.
- **POS Billing & GST**: Submitted POS Invoice `ACC-PSINV-2026-00081` for `ITEM-001` with cash payment. Correct India Compliance GST splits (`9% CGST` + `9% SGST`) were calculated and applied, resulting in a grand total of `₹1,180.00`.
- **License status**: Verified that the offline license signature is validated, status is `Active` and health is `Healthy`.
- **Help Center & Go-Live**: Verified `/smriti-help` dynamic articles and `/smriti-go-live` dashboard are fully functional. The Go-Live Checklist reports a **Ready for Go-Live** status with `13 Passed` checks.
- **Backup & Security Config**: Confirmed `/security` settings load correctly.

### 3. Backup & Restore Validation
- **Backup Creation**: Executed `bench backup` inside the container, producing a clean database dump (`20260618_165032-smriti_retail-database.sql.gz`).
- **Restore Execution**: Successfully ran `bench restore` with the `--force` option and database root credentials.
- **Verification**: Verified database integrity after restore by looking up invoice `ACC-PSINV-2026-00081` and confirming POS billing continues to load cleanly.

### 4. Release snapshots & Rollback Package
We have generated and archived the following in the artifacts directory and inside the final governance tarball:
- **`smriti_schema_snapshot.sql`**: Full MySQL schema definitions for all 14 custom SMRITI DocType tables extracted using native `mysqldump` to avoid code clutter.
- **`site_config_snapshot.json`**: Current configuration variables.
- **`installed_apps.txt`**: List of installed apps and commit revisions.
- **`release_environment.txt`**: System runtime version matrix.
- **`rollback/`**: Rollback folder containing pre-freeze database sql backup, configuration snapshot, git commit hashes, and detailed step-by-step restoration instructions.
