# SMRITI UI & Agent Verification Governance Rules

To prevent unverified or phantom claims of code completion and testing, all coding assistant agents MUST follow these strict rules before declaring a task "done" or reporting test results:

## 1. Verifiable Code Diffs (MANDATORY)
For every file modified, created, or deleted, you MUST run a git diff and paste the literal `git diff` output for that exact file.
- Do NOT paraphrase the diff in prose.
- If a file is claimed to be modified but no diff can be produced, state that it was not actually committed or changed.

## 2. Literal Terminal Test Outputs
Do not summarize test results in tables or bullet points (e.g., "9/9 passed") without providing the literal terminal output of the test run.
- Paste the exact command executed.
- Paste the literal stdout and stderr returned by the test runner.

## 3. Mandatory Validator/Linter Re-run
After editing any file, you must run the relevant validator or linter script (e.g. `validate_tokens.py` for CSS/style changes) and paste the exact console output of the linter execution.
- If no linter exists for the modified file type, state so explicitly.

## 4. Measurement Evidence for Metrics
Do not claim metrics (e.g. "80% query reduction", "0 console errors") unless you provide the exact before-and-after measurements taken.
- If a metric was not measured, do not state a percentage or integer; describe the qualitative changes instead.

## 5. Verify Prior Session Claims
Do not build on top of a previous session summary's claims without first inspecting the actual codebase to verify those claims are true.

## 6. Granular and Enumerated Scope
Do not summarize file changes under high-level descriptions (e.g., "fixed the whole module" or "updated all templates") unless you list every single affected file and confirm the changes for each one individually.

## 7. Explicit "Unverified" Status
If you are unsure whether a change is correct or has fully solved the issue, explicitly label the task status as "unverified" rather than "done". Do not round up unverified items.

## 8. No Summary Judgments
Do not append an overall quality score, a star rating, a "production-ready" verdict, or congratulatory framing (✅, "successfully," "robust," "strong foundation") to a verification report.
- State only what was checked and what the literal output showed.
- Do not assign a numeric score (e.g. "9.8/10") to your own work, in whole or by category.
- Do not declare a module, file, or feature "production-ready" — that is a judgment for the human to make from the evidence presented, not a conclusion the agent reaches on its own behalf.
- Avoid qualitative language such as "robust," "excellent," "strong," "enterprise-grade" — unless explicitly attributed to a human decision rather than stated as the verifier's own conclusion.
- It is still reasonable, and required by Rule 7, to classify **verification state** — provided the classification is one of these four objective status values, and nothing else:
  ```
  Done                 — change made, verified with evidence per Rules 1–4
  Failed                — change attempted, verification shows it did not work
  Partially Verified    — some evidence gathered, some claims still unconfirmed
  Unverified            — claimed, but no evidence has been gathered yet
  ```
  These are states, not opinions — they describe what was checked, not how good the result is. Do not substitute a different word for these four, and do not add a score alongside them.

## 9. Show Outputs, Not Just Actions
Narrating that a command was run, a file was edited, or a tool was used is not evidence of what happened. Every action must be followed immediately by the actual output it produced — not a transition straight to the next step.
- "Ran command: `X`" must be followed by the literal stdout/stderr of that command, even if empty, even if it's a single line.
- "Edited `file.py`" must be followed by either the diff (per Rule 1) or, if the editing tool returned a confirmation/error, that literal return value.
- "Used tool: `Y`" must be followed by that tool's actual return value, not a paraphrase of what the agent expects or assumes it did.
- A sequence of "Ran command... Edited... Ran command..." steps with no shown output between them, followed only by a closing prose summary, does not satisfy Rules 1–7 even if the summary's claims are individually plausible.

## 10. Separate Evidence From Interpretation From Recommendation
Every verification report must structure its conclusions into three explicitly labeled parts, in this order:
- **Evidence:** the literal, unmodified output (diff, terminal log, linter output, measurement) per Rules 1–4.
- **Interpretation:** what that output means, stated plainly, with no claim beyond what the evidence actually supports, avoiding subjective qualifiers (e.g., do not describe results as "robust", "excellent", "strong", "production-ready", or "enterprise-grade").
- **Recommendation:** what to do next, clearly marked as a suggestion, not a fact.
- When a tool's output disagrees with what manual inspection shows (for example, a linter flags a "conflict" between two values that, once resolved through their var() chains, are actually identical), say so explicitly under Interpretation: state what the tool reported, what manual resolution showed, and why they differ. Do not silently prefer one over the other or average them into a vague middle conclusion.
- A Recommendation must never be phrased as if it were Evidence. "This should be reviewed before expanding scope" is a Recommendation. "This is reviewed" is a false Evidence claim if no review actually happened.

### Self-check before sending any report
Before presenting a verification report, the agent should confirm:
- [ ] Every modified file has a pasted diff (Rule 1), not a description
- [ ] Every test claim has pasted terminal output (Rule 2)
- [ ] Every lint/validator claim has pasted console output (Rule 3)
- [ ] Every metric has a shown before/after measurement (Rule 4)
- [ ] Prior session claims were independently re-checked, not assumed (Rule 5)
- [ ] Scope is enumerated file-by-file, not summarized at module level (Rule 6)
- [ ] Every item is labeled with one of exactly four states — Done, Failed, Partially Verified, Unverified — not a score or adjective (Rules 7–8)
- [ ] No score, star rating, or "production-ready" verdict appears anywhere (Rule 8)
- [ ] Every "Ran command" / "Edited" / "Used tool" line is followed by its actual output (Rule 9)
- [ ] Evidence, Interpretation, and Recommendation appear as distinct labeled sections, not blended into one narrative (Rule 10)
